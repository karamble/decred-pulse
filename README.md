## What is Decred Pulse?

Decred Pulse is a comprehensive dashboard that provides:
- **Node Dashboard**: Monitor your dcrd node performance, blockchain sync status, network peers, and mempool activity
- **Wallet Dashboard**: Track your wallet balances, transactions, staking tickets, and ticket pool statistics
- **Block Explorer**: Browse blocks, transactions, and addresses directly from your node

All data comes from your local dcrd and dcrwallet instances via RPC - no third-party services required.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- 10GB+ free disk space for blockchain data

### Launch

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/karamble/decred-pulse.git
cd decred-pulse

# 2. Set up environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your preferred RPC password
nano .env

# 3. Start all services
docker compose up -d

# 4. Access the dashboard
# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

The first run will sync the blockchain (takes 4-8 hours for mainnet). Monitor progress with:
```bash
docker compose logs -f dcrd
```

### Using Makefile

```bash
make start       # Start all services
make stop        # Stop all services
make logs        # View logs
make status      # Check status
```

For more commands: `make help`
