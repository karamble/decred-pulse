# Staking Guide

Complete guide to Decred Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking using the Decred Pulse dashboard. Learn how to monitor ticket pools, track your tickets, and understand staking rewards.

## üìñ What is Decred Staking?

**Decred staking** is the process of time-locking DCR to purchase **tickets** that participate in network governance and consensus. In return, you earn staking rewards when your tickets are called to vote.

### Key Concepts

**Ticket**: A special transaction that locks DCR for voting
**Ticket Price**: The cost to purchase a ticket (changes every 144 blocks)
**Ticket Pool**: All active tickets waiting to be called to vote
**Voting**: When your ticket is selected to validate a block
**VSP**: Voting Service Provider (optional, ensures ticket votes even if offline)

---

## üé´ Ticket Lifecycle

### 1. Purchase (Mempool) ‚è≥
- Buy ticket at current ticket price
- Transaction enters mempool
- Awaiting confirmation
- **Duration**: ~5 minutes (1 block)

### 2. Immature üê£
- Ticket confirmed on blockchain
- Not yet eligible to vote
- Gaining maturity
- **Duration**: ~21 hours (256 blocks)

### 3. Live/Unspent ‚úÖ
- Ticket enters the pool
- Eligible to be called for voting
- **Duration**: ~28 days average (142 days max)
- **Probability**: Random selection per block

### 4. Voting üó≥Ô∏è
- Ticket is selected to vote
- Validates previous block
- Earns voting reward
- **Reward**: ~0.8% of ticket price

### 5. Voted ‚úÖ
- Vote confirmed
- Reward + ticket price returned
- Rewards are immature for 256 blocks
- **Total Return**: Ticket price + ~0.8% reward

### Alternative Outcomes

**Expired** ‚åõ
- Not selected within 142 days (~40,960 blocks)
- Must be revoked to recover funds
- No reward earned

**Revoked** ‚ùå
- Manual or automatic revocation
- Original ticket price returned (minus small fee)
- No reward earned

## üìä Understanding the Dashboard

### Ticket Pool Info Card

Monitor the global Decred ticket pool:

#### Pool Size üé´
**Current**: Number of live tickets in the pool
**Target**: ~40,960 tickets
**Significance**: Higher pool = more decentralization

**What you see**:
```
Pool Size: 41,095 tickets
```

**What it means**:
- Network has 41,095 active tickets
- Your ticket competes with these for voting
- Healthy network participation

---

#### Current Difficulty üíé
**What it is**: The current ticket price in DCR
**Updates**: Every 144 blocks (~12 hours)
**Algorithm**: Adjusts to maintain ~40,960 pool size

**What you see**:
```
Current Difficulty: 293.08 DCR
```

**What it means**:
- Next ticket purchase costs 293.08 DCR
- This is the price you'll pay now
- Changes at next difficulty adjustment

---

#### Next Difficulty üîÑ
**What it is**: Estimated next ticket price
**Timing**: Updates in next difficulty window
**Calculation**: Based on recent demand

**What you see**:
```
Next Difficulty: 293.08 DCR
```

**What it means**:
- Expected price for next window
- Same = stable demand
- Higher = increasing demand
- Lower = decreasing demand

---

#### Estimated Difficulty Range üìä
**What it is**: Price prediction range
**Based on**: Recent ticket purchases
**Algorithm**: `estimatestakediff` RPC

**What you see**:
```
Min: 291.54 DCR
Expected: 292.20 DCR
Max: 294.59 DCR
```

**What it means**:
- **Min**: Lowest possible next price
- **Expected**: Most likely next price  
- **Max**: Highest possible next price

**Usage**: Plan your ticket purchases

---

#### Mempool Tickets ‚è≥
**What it is**: Network-wide pending ticket purchases
**Status**: Awaiting confirmation
**Accuracy**: Calculated using stake difficulty

**What you see**:
```
All Mempool Tickets: 15
```

**What it means**:
- 15 tickets being purchased network-wide
- Will confirm in next block
- Will become immature tickets

**Technical Note**: Count calculated by:
```
Total Stake Submission Outputs / Current Stake Difficulty
```
This accurately counts tickets even in coinjoin transactions.

---

### My Tickets Card

Track your personal ticket statistics:

#### Mempool ‚è≥
**Your pending tickets**
- Just purchased
- Awaiting first confirmation
- Not yet immature

**Typical count**: 0-1 (unless batch purchasing)

**What to expect**:
- Moves to immature after ~5 minutes
- If stuck, check transaction fee

---

#### Immature üê£
**Your maturing tickets**
- Confirmed but not yet live
- Requires 256 confirmations
- ~21 hours until live

**Typical count**: 0-5 (depending on purchase frequency)

**What to expect**:
- Becomes live after 256 blocks
- Cannot vote yet
- Funds are locked

---

#### Live/Unspent ‚úÖ
**Your active tickets**
- In the ticket pool
- Eligible to vote on every block
- Average lifetime: ~28 days

**Typical count**: Varies by staking strategy

**What to expect**:
- Random selection for voting
- Average 28-day wait
- Max 142-day expiry

**Probability per block**:
```
Chance = 5 votes needed / ~40,960 pool size
      ‚âà 0.012% per block
      ‚âà 28 days average
```

---

#### Voted üó≥Ô∏è
**Your successful votes**
- Tickets that have voted
- Rewards earned
- Historical count

**Typical count**: Accumulates over time

**What to expect**:
- Rewards + ticket price returned
- Rewards immature for 256 blocks
- Then available as spendable

---

#### Revoked ‚ùå
**Your revoked tickets**
- Manually revoked
- Auto-revoked after expiry
- Funds recovered (minus fee)

**Typical count**: Low (most tickets vote)

**What to expect**:
- ~5% of tickets expire (statistically)
- Auto-revoke with `enablevoting=1`
- Manual revoke if needed

---

#### Expired ‚åõ
**Your expired unspent tickets**
- Not selected within 142 days
- Awaiting revocation
- Funds still locked

**Typical count**: Should be 0 with auto-revoke

**Action needed**:
- Manually revoke if auto-revoke disabled
- Run: `dcrctl rebroadcastmissed`

---

#### Total Subsidy üí∞
**Cumulative voting rewards**
- All-time earnings from voting
- Excludes original ticket prices
- Only the ~0.8% rewards

**Typical value**: Grows with each vote

**Calculation**:
```
Per Vote ‚âà Ticket Price √ó 0.008
```

**Example**:
- Ticket Price: 293 DCR
- Reward: ~2.34 DCR per vote
- 10 votes: ~23.4 DCR total subsidy

---

## üí∞ Staking Economics

### Costs

**Ticket Price**
- Current: Check "Current Difficulty" card
- Historical Range: 30-600 DCR
- Current Range: 200-350 DCR (typical)

**VSP Fee** (if using VSP)
- Typical: 0.5-5% of reward
- One-time per ticket
- Deducted from voting reward

**Transaction Fees**
- Purchase: ~0.01 DCR
- Revocation: ~0.01 DCR
- Voting: Paid by VSP or your wallet

### Returns

**Voting Reward**
- Approximate: ~0.8% of ticket price per vote
- Annual ROI: ~6-7% (varies)
- Compounds if restaked

**Example**:
```
Ticket Price: 300 DCR
Voting Reward: ~2.4 DCR
Time Locked: ~28 days average
Annual ROI: ~7.1%
```

**Calculation**:
```
ROI per vote = (Reward / Ticket Price) √ó 100
             = (2.4 / 300) √ó 100
             ‚âà 0.8%

Annual ROI = 0.8% √ó (365 / 28)
           ‚âà 10.4% theoretical

Actual ROI ‚âà 6-7% (accounting for expiries, timing)
```

### Risk Factors

**Expiration Risk**
- ~5% chance ticket expires without voting
- No reward if expired
- Can revoke to recover funds

**Price Volatility**
- DCR price may fluctuate
- Locked for ~28 days average
- Consider your risk tolerance

**Opportunity Cost**
- Funds locked during staking
- Cannot use for other purposes
- Compare returns to alternatives

## üéØ Staking Strategies

### Conservative Staking
**Goal**: Steady, predictable returns
**Approach**:
- Purchase tickets regularly (DCA)
- Use VSP for reliability
- Auto-revoke expired tickets
- Reinvest rewards

**Best for**: Long-term holders, passive stakers

---

### Active Staking
**Goal**: Maximize returns, active management
**Approach**:
- Time purchases at low difficulty
- Monitor pool size trends
- Solo stake (if always online)
- Optimize transaction fees

**Best for**: Experienced users, technical operators

---

### Accumulation Staking
**Goal**: Grow DCR holdings
**Approach**:
- Reinvest all rewards into new tickets
- Compound returns over time
- Long-term commitment
- Regular monitoring

**Best for**: HODLers, accumulation phase

---

## üì± Monitoring Your Stakes

### Daily Checks
‚úÖ Live ticket count (stable or growing?)
‚úÖ Voted tickets (earning rewards?)
‚úÖ Expired tickets (need revoking?)
‚úÖ Immature tickets (recently purchased?)

### Weekly Checks
‚úÖ Total subsidy (rewards accumulating?)
‚úÖ Ticket difficulty trends (buy now or wait?)
‚úÖ Pool size changes (network health?)
‚úÖ Revoked count (within expected ~5%?)

### Monthly Reviews
‚úÖ Total ROI calculation
‚úÖ Reward reinvestment strategy
‚úÖ Difficulty trend analysis
‚úÖ VSP performance (if using)

## üîß Staking Operations

### Purchasing Tickets

**Via `dcrwallet` CLI:**
```bash
dcrctl --wallet purchaseticket default 300 1 $(dcrctl --wallet getnewaddress)
```

**Parameters**:
- `default`: Account to purchase from
- `300`: Maximum price willing to pay
- `1`: Number of tickets to purchase
- `getnewaddress`: Commitment address

**Via `dcrwallet` RPC:**
See [Wallet Operations Guide](../guides/wallet-operations.md) for API details.

---

### Automatic Ticket Buying

**Enable in `dcrwallet.conf`:**
```ini
enableticketbuyer=1
ticketbuyer.limit=10
ticketbuyer.maxpricerelative=1.25
```

**Settings**:
- `limit`: Max tickets to maintain
- `maxpricerelative`: Max price relative to average (1.25 = 125%)

**Caution**: Only for experienced users with sufficient balance.

---

### Using a VSP (Voting Service Provider)

**Why use a VSP?**
- Ensures votes even if you're offline
- Professional infrastructure
- Small fee for reliability

**Setup**:
1. Choose a VSP from [decred.org/vsp](https://decred.org/vsp/)
2. Register and get VSP pubkey
3. Configure in `dcrwallet`:
   ```ini
   enablevoting=1
   vsp.url=https://your-vsp.com
   vsp.pubkey=your-vsp-pubkey
   ```

**Dashboard Monitoring**:
- Voted tickets should appear normally
- VSP handles the voting process
- You earn rewards minus VSP fee

---

### Revoking Expired Tickets

**Automatic Revocation** (recommended):
```ini
# dcrwallet.conf
enablevoting=1
```

**Manual Revocation**:
```bash
dcrctl --wallet rebroadcastmissed
```

**Check for Missed**:
```bash
dcrctl --wallet getstakeinfo
```

Look for `unspentexpired` count.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Tickets Showing in Dashboard

**Problem**: My Tickets card shows zeros

**Solutions**:
1. **Watch-only wallet**: 
   - Cannot display tickets with xpub import
   - Need full RPC connection
   - See: [Wallet Setup](../wallet-setup.md)

2. **Recently purchased**:
   - Check mempool count
   - Wait for confirmation
   - May take 5+ minutes

3. **RPC connection issue**:
   - Verify wallet is connected
   - Check credentials
   - Restart backend/wallet

---

### Ticket Stuck in Mempool

**Problem**: Mempool ticket not confirming

**Solutions**:
1. **Low transaction fee**:
   - May take multiple blocks
   - Check mempool competition
   - Consider fee bump (advanced)

2. **Full mempool**:
   - Wait for next block
   - Typically confirms within 1-2 blocks

3. **Transaction error**:
   - Check wallet logs
   - Verify sufficient balance
   - Ensure correct ticket price

---

### Expired Tickets Not Auto-Revoking

**Problem**: Expired count growing

**Solutions**:
1. **Enable auto-revoke**:
   ```ini
   enablevoting=1
   ```

2. **Manual revoke**:
   ```bash
   dcrctl --wallet rebroadcastmissed
   ```

3. **Check wallet online**:
   - Wallet must be running
   - Must be synced
   - Must have connectivity

---

### Lower Than Expected ROI

**Problem**: Returns below advertised ~7%

**Possible causes**:
1. **Recent start**: Not enough data yet
2. **Expired tickets**: ~5% don't vote
3. **VSP fees**: Reduces net return
4. **Price timing**: Bought at high difficulty
5. **Short duration**: ROI averages over time

**Check**:
- Total voted vs expired ratio
- Average time to vote
- VSP fee structure
- Difficulty trend during purchases

---

## üìä Advanced Metrics

### Effective ROI Calculation

```
Total Earned = Total Subsidy
Total Invested = (Avg Ticket Price) √ó (Total Tickets Bought)
Time Period = Days since first ticket

Annual ROI = (Total Earned / Total Invested) √ó (365 / Time Period) √ó 100
```

### Expected Vote Time

```
Average Time = (Pool Size / 5 votes per block) √ó 5 minutes per block

Current: (40,960 / 5) √ó 5 = 40,960 minutes
       = 28.4 days average
```

### Expiration Probability

```
Probability = 1 - (1 - 5/PoolSize)^MaxBlocks

Max Blocks = 40,960 (142 days)
Pool Size = 40,960
Probability ‚âà 5%
```
