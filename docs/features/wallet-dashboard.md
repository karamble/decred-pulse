When no tickets are shown:

üé´ No tickets found

Connect to an external wallet via RPC to see stats

Note: Tickets cannot be detected on watch-only wallets 
with imported xpub keys
```

**Why?** Watch-only wallets (xpub imports) cannot access ticket information because:
- Ticket data requires private key access
- Xpub only provides address monitoring
- Connect via RPC for full ticket tracking

---

## üîÑ Sync Progress Tracking

When performing wallet operations (rescan, xpub import), a **sync progress bar** appears:

### Features
- **Real-time Progress**: Shows percentage complete
- **Log Parsing**: Monitors `dcrwallet.log` for progress
- **Smart Polling**: Polls every 2 seconds during sync
- **Auto-Hide**: Disappears at 99% completion
- **Stale Detection**: Stops polling if logs become stale

### During Sync
- Dashboard cards are hidden
- Only sync progress bar visible
- Regular polling paused to prevent timeouts
- Background RPC calls suspended

### After Sync Completion
- Progress bar automatically hides
- Dashboard cards reappear
- Normal polling resumes (30-second intervals)
- Data refreshed immediately

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Auto-Refresh
Dashboard refreshes every **30 seconds** automatically.

To adjust refresh interval, modify:
```typescript
// frontend/src/pages/WalletDashboard.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(fetchData, 30000); // Change 30000 to desired ms
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

### Transaction Display Limits
By default:
- Initial display: **10 transactions**
- Load more: **50 transactions** per click
- Backend fetches: **100 transactions** total

To adjust:
```typescript
// frontend/src/components/TransactionHistory.tsx
const [visibleCount, setVisibleCount] = useState(10);  // Initial display
const loadMoreCount = 50;  // Load more increment

// Backend: modify count parameter
const data = await getWalletTransactions(100);  // Total to fetch
```

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Performance
1. ‚úÖ Wait for full blockchain sync before rescanning
2. ‚úÖ Use appropriate gap limit (200 recommended)
3. ‚úÖ Don't navigate away during wallet rescan
4. ‚úÖ Monitor sync progress through dashboard

### For Accurate Balance Display
1. ‚úÖ Allow time for confirmations to mature
2. ‚úÖ Check "immature" balances for pending rewards
3. ‚úÖ Remember locked balance requires ticket voting/expiry
4. ‚úÖ Refresh dashboard if balances seem outdated

### For Watch-Only Wallets
1. ‚úÖ Import xpub for address monitoring
2. ‚úÖ Use appropriate gap limit (200+)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Ticket info requires full RPC connection
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot send transactions (watch-only)

### For Transaction History
1. ‚úÖ Click transactions to view blockchain details
2. ‚úÖ Use "Load More" for older transactions
3. ‚úÖ Check confirmations before considering final
4. ‚úÖ Reference txid for support/tracking

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Balances Not Updating
**Problem**: Dashboard shows outdated balances

**Solutions:**
1. Check wallet is synced: Verify sync status in header
2. Wait for confirmations: Check transaction confirmations
3. Refresh manually: Click refresh button
4. Check RPC connection: Verify wallet connectivity

### No Transactions Showing
**Problem**: Transaction history is empty

**Solutions:**
1. **Watch-only wallet**: Import xpub with correct gap limit
2. **New wallet**: No transactions yet
3. **High address index**: Increase gap limit and rescan
4. **Sync incomplete**: Wait for wallet to finish syncing

### Ticket Counts Incorrect
**Problem**: Ticket statistics don't match expectations

**Solutions:**
1. **Watch-only wallet**: Connect via RPC for ticket data
2. **Sync in progress**: Wait for sync completion
3. **Expired tickets**: Check "expired" count
4. **Recently purchased**: Check "immature" count

### Sync Progress Stuck
**Problem**: Rescan progress bar frozen

**Solutions:**
1. Check dcrwallet logs: `docker compose logs -f dcrwallet`
2. Verify dcrwallet is running: `docker compose ps`
3. Check for stale logs: Backend auto-detects stale progress
4. Restart if necessary: `docker compose restart dcrwallet`

### Cards Not Appearing After Rescan
**Problem**: Dashboard cards don't show after rescan completes

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh page: Force browser refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check for errors: Open browser console (F12)
3. Verify completion: Check logs for 100% progress
4. Manual refresh: Click refresh button in dashboard

- Never exposed to frontend
- Use strong passwords
- Rotate regularly

### Watch-Only Wallets
- Safe for monitoring
- Cannot spend funds
- Limited information access
- Xpub can be shared (carefully)

### Wallet Access
- Secure RPC endpoint
- Use TLS for remote access
- Firewall RPC ports
- Monitor access logs
