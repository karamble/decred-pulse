# First Steps

What to do after installing Decred Pulse. This guide will help you get started with monitoring your Decred node and managing your wallet.

## üéØ Quick Checklist

After installation, complete these steps:

- [ ] Wait for initial blockchain sync
- [ ] Access the dashboard
- [ ] Verify node connectivity
- [ ] (Optional) Connect wallet
- [ ] (Optional) Import xpub for watch-only
- [ ] Explore the dashboard
- [ ] Set up monitoring routine

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Wait for Initial Blockchain Sync

### What's Happening

After starting Decred Pulse, `dcrd` begins downloading and validating the blockchain.

**Time Required**:
- **Mainnet**: 4-8 hours
- **Testnet**: 30-60 minutes

**Disk Space**:
- **Mainnet**: ~10 GB
- **Testnet**: ~1-2 GB

---

### Monitor Sync Progress

**Via Dashboard**:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Node Status card shows sync progress
3. Progress bar indicates percentage complete

**Via CLI**:
```bash
# Check sync status
make sync-status

# View logs
make logs-dcrd

# Watch logs for progress
docker compose logs -f dcrd | grep -i "sync\|block"
```

**What to Look For**:
```
Syncing to block height 1016401 (100.00%)
Processed 36,000 headers in the last 30 seconds
Verified 1200 blocks in the last 30 seconds
```

---

### Sync Phases

#### Phase 1: Headers Sync (~5-15 minutes)
- Downloads block headers first
- Very fast
- Shows "Downloading headers..."

#### Phase 2: Blocks Sync (4-8 hours)
- Downloads full blocks
- Validates transactions
- Shows "Downloading blocks..."

#### Phase 3: Final Validation (~10-30 minutes)
- Completes verification
- Builds indexes
- Shows "Finalizing..."

---

### Tips During Sync

‚úÖ **Do**:
- Let it run uninterrupted
- Keep computer running
- Maintain internet connection
- Monitor logs occasionally

‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't**:
- Stop services during sync
- Shut down computer
- Disconnect internet
- Modify configuration

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Dashboard

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Wallet (Optional)

### If You Have a Wallet

If you have an existing `dcrwallet` or Decrediton wallet:

#### Option A: Use Built-in dcrwallet

**Status**: dcrwallet is already running in Docker

**Check Status**:
```bash
# View wallet status
make wallet-info

# View balance
make wallet-balance
```

#### Option B: Import Xpub (Watch-Only)

**For monitoring only** (cannot send transactions):

1. Export xpub from your wallet:
   ```bash
   # From dcrwallet
   dcrctl --wallet getmasterpubkey default
   
   # Or from Decrediton: Accounts ‚Üí Export
   ```

2. Open Wallet Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/wallet

3. Click "Import Xpub" button

4. Enter:
   - **Xpub key**: Your extended public key
   - **Gap limit**: 200 (recommended)

5. Click "Import"

6. Wait for rescan to complete (~10-30 minutes)

**See**: [Wallet Operations Guide](../guides/wallet-operations.md#import-extended-public-key-xpub)

---

### If You Don't Have a Wallet

**Create a new wallet**:

```bash
# Create new wallet via CLI
docker exec -it decred-pulse-dcrwallet dcrctl --wallet create

# Follow prompts to:
# 1. Set passphrase
# 2. Generate seed
# 3. Confirm seed
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Save your seed phrase securely offline!

**View seed** (one-time, right after creation):
```bash
make wallet-seed
```

## üêõ Common First-Time Issues

### Issue: "RPC Not Connected"

**Cause**: dcrd not ready yet

**Solution**: Wait 30-60 seconds, refresh page

**If persists**:
```bash
# Check dcrd status
make status

# View logs
make logs-dcrd

# Restart if needed
docker compose restart dcrd
```

---

### Issue: "Slow Sync"

**Cause**: Normal for first sync

**Solutions**:
- Be patient (4-8 hours normal)
- Ensure good internet
- Check peers connected (8+)
- Use SSD if possible

---

### Issue: "Out of Disk Space"

**Cause**: Blockchain needs ~10 GB

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check space
df -h

# Clean Docker
docker system prune -a

# Free system space
# Remove unnecessary files
```

---

### Issue: "Wallet Not Synced"

**Cause**: Need to wait for dcrd sync first

**Solution**: 
1. Wait for dcrd to reach 100%
2. Then dcrwallet will sync automatically
3. May take additional 10-30 minutes
